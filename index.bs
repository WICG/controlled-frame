Title: Controlled Frame API
Abstract: This document defines an API for embedding arbitrary web content only
    within the context of an Isolated Web Application (IWA). The embedded
    content is a new top-level browsing context within and controlled by the
    embedder.

# Introduction # {#introduction}
<!-- ====================================================================== -->

This specification describes a content embedding API that satisfies some
critical use cases for IWAs that <{iframe}> does not support. This embedding
environment should allow embedding all content without express permission from
the embedded site, including content which <{iframe}> cannot embed, and provide
embedding sites more control over that embedded content.

Since this is a particularly powerful API, its use and availability makes an app
a target of various types of hacking. As a result, this API is limited to use in
[[Isolated-Web-Apps|Isolated Web Applications]] (IWAs) which have addtional
safeguards in place to protect users and developers.  IWAs are not a normal web
application and can exist only at a special 'isolated-app:' scheme. This means
by design that this API will not be available to normal web pages.

Note: This API is not intended to be a replacement or substitute for <{iframe}>.
All <{iframe}> use cases are still valid and should continue to use <{iframe}>,
including IWAs where possible.

# Usage Overview # {#usage-overview}
<!-- ====================================================================== -->

Lorem ipsum. Insert basic info and example here.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
# Motivating Applications # {#motivating-applications}
<!-- ====================================================================== -->

*This section is non-normative.*

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Latency-sensitive applications in virtualized sessions ## {#browser-content-redirection}
<!-- ====================================================================== -->

In virtualized environments, users typically have a local thin client that
renders a full virtual desktop. The actual desktop execution environment will be
running on a remote virtualization server. If the user's browser navigates to a
latency-sensitive application (such as a video app), the rendered content will
have additional latency ("lag") that makes the experience difficult or
impossible for the user. This also applies for applications that record the
user, such as video conferencing applications. In these latency-sensitive
applications, the virtual desktop application can render the latency-sensitive
content locally and overlay it on top of the rendered remote content to reduce
this latency. This use case is also known as "browser content redirection."

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Embedding third party web content without restriction ## {#no-embedding-prohibitions}
<!-- ====================================================================== -->

In a kiosk environment, applications must load content from third parties and
display that content on screens within their applications. A teacher may trigger
the navigation event, or it may be configured by an administrator such as a
shopping mall manager. The content may prohibit embedding by <{iframe}> through
the use of X-Frame-Options and CSP. An controlled frame, however, should be able
to load all content, even content that prohibits embedding by <{iframe}>.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Remote display and manipulation of web content ## {#remote-content-control}
<!-- ====================================================================== -->

In a kiosk environment, applications must ensure that content continues to
display on screens and may need to interrupt content with their own supplied
behaviors. This behavior should work without local attendance by an
administrator, and ideally can be managed remotely over the network. If content
were to crash, for example, these applications should observe and respond to the
crash by reloading the content in a fresh embedded view.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Clearing user content after each session ## {#clearing-session-data}
<!-- ====================================================================== -->

In some environments, someone only uses a single device for a brief time to
complete their task, like ordering in a restaurant. When their task is complete,
the embedder application should be able to clear all of the local user data
associated with the task and then restart the embedded instance.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Monitor for idle sessions ## {#monitor-idle-sessions}
<!-- ====================================================================== -->

While users interact with embedded content, the user may not explicitly end
their session. This content may assume the user is present when they have
actually finished or departed without completing the task. Embedder applications
want to detect when users idle over their case's threshold and begin a fresh
session.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Arbitrarily blocking navigations ## {#blocking-navigations}
<!-- ====================================================================== -->

While displaying embedded web content that's not authored by the embedder, pages
may link to third party web content that's disallowed. Allowing the embedder to
edit elements in embedded content through arbitrary script injection into the
web content can ensure navigation cannot occur to blocked pages. The embedder
can also use the Controlled Frame API to capture navigation events and ensure
that only pages to approved sites can be loaded within that controlled frame.

<b>Controlled Frame is based upon [[Isolated-Web-Apps]] (IWA)
and integrates with core security specs</b>

Since Controlled Frame is a particularly powerful API, using it or even having
it available makes an app a target of various types of hacking. As a result,
this API is limited to use in [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] which have additional
safeguards in place to protect application developers and users. The Isolated
Web App explainer has this to say:

> <i>"A user agent may also force an application to adopt this threat model if
the developer needs access to APIs which would make the application an appealing
target for XSS or server-side attacks."</i>

Controlled Frame makes just such an appealing target, and to expose this with
caution we're opting into [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] to guard against certain
attacks. Generally, [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWAs]] provide strong security
assurances that each of the resources in an application are secure both at rest
and in-transit. You can read more about [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWAs]] security and
permissions in the [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] explainer and the
[[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWAs]] [[High-Watermark-Permissions]] explainer.

Controlled Frame integrates with [[!Permissions-Policy]] and [[!Permissions]].
You can read more about [[Permissions-Policy#privacy]] and
[[Permissions#security-considerations]] (note the entry is currently sparse).

<b>Attacking web sites could display content that doesn't otherwise allow itself
to be embedded and trick users on non-[[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWAs]].</b>

Planned mitigation:

-  Controlled Frame will only be available within [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWAs]]

<b>An [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] may embed another [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] (or
itself) via Controlled Frame to manipulate our [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]]
policies somehow (e.g. an Controlled Frame embedded [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]]
may detect it's being embedded due to the absence of the "controlledframe"
policy-controlled feature).</b>

Planned mitigation:

-  Controlled Frame can only point to "https" schemes, excluding the
    "isolated-app" scheme used for [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWAs]]

<b>Controlled Frame could gain access to the powerful &lt;controlledframe&gt;
element.</b>

An [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] that's not expected to use Controlled Frame may
attempt to embed content.

Planned mitigation:

-  Only embedder applications and their same-origin [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]]
    child navigables that have been granted the "controlledframe"
    policy-controlled feature will be allowed access to the Controlled Frame
    element.
-  Same-origin child navigables without the "controlledframe"
    policy-controlled feature will not be allowed to use a Controlled Frame
    element (to be confirmed, see note below)
-  Cross-origin iframes to [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWAs]] can use the "allow"
    attribute to disable Controlled Frame
-  Cross-origin iframes to non-[[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWAs]] will not have
    access to the "controlledframe" policy-controlled feature, and so will not
    be allowed to use a Controlled Frame element
-  See the "Embedder Policies Using the "controlledframe" Feature" section
    above for more details

<b>An IWA may attempt to embed content from non-https schemes, such as 'http:'
or 'isolated-app:'</b>

Planned mitigation:

-  Controlled Frame will only work when the navigable's "src" URL has an
    'https:' scheme

<b>Malicious Controlled Frame could access the embedder's running process (eg.
Spectre attack)</b>

Planned mitigation:

-  Controlled Frame will be executed in a separate process from the
    embedder's process

<b>Controlled Frame for a given "https origin" could interact or interfere with
the user's own storage user agent data for that https origin</b>

Planned mitigation:

-  Controlled Frame will always store data in a separate storage user agent
    that's apart from the default storage user agent
-  Data written to by a given "https origin" while the user accesses that
    origin via an [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] Controlled Frame will be isolated
    from the user's storage user agent that backs "normal" window and tab usage,
    and vice versa

<b>Malicious Controlled Frame could overwrite embedder's stored data</b>

-  The embedder and embedded storage user agent could overlap, and possibly
    multiple same-site [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] child navigables could be
    affected by activity in the Controlled Frame
-  if storage user agents were shared between the embedder and embedded
    sites, clearing data for either one could negatively impact the other

Planned mitigation:

-  [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] and Controlled Frame will always have separate
    storage user agents
-  A Controlled Frame should not have read or write access to other storage
    user agents besides its own

<b>Malicious Controlled Frame may detect it is embedded and attempt to attack
the embedder application</b>

Planned mitigation:

-  The user agent will match the browser.
-  The Controlled Frame storage user agent will be separate from the
    [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] and the default storage user agents.
-  The Controlled Frame process will be separate from the
    [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] and the default renderer and browser processes.
-  The Controlled Frame environment will appear to be the top-most navigable:
    -  window should match window.parent and window.top
    -  List of policy-controlled features and their disable/enable status
        should match the default for a navigable

Ideas:

-  Investigate for potential interactions around filesystem, quota storage,
    and localStorage APIs

<b>User may not be able to verify the origin of the page being viewed in the
Controlled Frame</b>

Ideas:

-  Expose the origin to the user somehow, such as adding UI at the top of a
    Controlled Frame that displays the origin?
-  Have the [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] specify in the manifest the origins that
    they expect to access?

<b>Controlled Frame may exploit vulnerabilities in out-of-date browser
engine</b>

Already addressed with:

-  Existing browser engine auto-update mechanisms

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Privacy ## {#privacy}
<!-- ====================================================================== -->

Controlled Frame integrates with Permissions Policy and Permissions. You can
read more about [[Permissions-Policy#privacy]].  You can read more about
[[Permissions#security-considerations]].

For Controlled Frame specifically, we've identified the following privacy
considerations:

-  Users' browsing within Controlled Frame will be visible to the
    [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]]
-  [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWAs]] can access and exfiltrate the Controlled Frame's
    session cookies (this only applies to the Controlled Frame's session since
    they use a separate storage partition from the [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] and
    the third party origin when browsed in a tab)
-  User activity in Controlled Frame can be observed by the
    [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] (e.g. keyboard events can be monitored, password
    entry can be sniffed)
-  User file upload to Controlled Frame can be hijacked
-  User data held in the Controlled Frame's remote server could be accessed by
    code implanted by the [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]]
-  Users that wish to clear their session history must also do so via the
    [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]], which will then need to clear the associated
    storage user agents
    -  This would be necessary since embedded storage user agents are separate
        from the non-embedded storage user agents for any given https origin
-  We plan to investigate browser UX to allow users to clear the Controlled
    Frame storage user agents, the following cases will be considered:
    -  If a user wants to clear site data for an [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]], the
        associated embedded storage user agents will also be cleared
        -  This is because if the [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]]'s data is cleared,
            the app will no longer have any context for the associated embedded
            storage user agents and therefore will no longer be used or useful
            to the user or organization
        -  As a result, we expect that clearing an [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]]'s
            site data will require clearing all of the associated embedded
            storage user agents
    -  A user may want to clear all site data for a given "https origin", even
        if that origin is stored within an [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]]'s embedded
        storage user agent
        -  We may choose to provide the ability to clear all
            [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] site data for that "https origin" even if
            that site data is held within an embedded storage user agent
        -  If we chose to clear the "https origin" data,
            [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWAs]] would need to prepare for the possibility
            that embedded storage user agents may be removed outside of their
            control, and this may be disruptive to the [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]]
            and introduce complexity of implementation
        -  Supporting this in the browser user agent exposes browser vendors,
            developers, and users to additional complexity, so we may choose not
            to support this approach and instead leave this up to
            [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] developers to implement
        -  As a counter example to supporting clearing a single given "https
            origin"'s embedded storage user agent, consider that to our
            knowledge no operating system behaves that way
            -  i.e. there's no central "clear browsing data" option which clears
                storage for all installed browser engines, each application's
                storage is treated as its own to manage
    -  User wants to clear the site data for a given [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]]'s
        Controlled Frame-embedded storage user agent for a given "https origin"
    -  User wants to clear the site data for a given [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]]'s
        Controlled Frame-embedded storage user agents for all "https origins"
-  An [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWA]] will need the ability to clear the storage user
    agent's Controlled Frame-embedded storage user agent for a given "https
    origin"

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Accessibility ## {#accessibility}
<!-- ====================================================================== -->

For Controlled Frame, we've identified the following accessibility
considerations:

-  Browser user agents' accessibility tools and APIs should have visibility into
    Controlled Frame
-  [[Isolated-Web-Apps|IWAs]] should expect to provide their own accessibility
    tools for Controlled Frame content in order to properly integrate
    accessibility features for some use cases (such as "browser content
    redirection")
